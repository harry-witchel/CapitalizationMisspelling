WHAT IS THIS PROJECT ABOUT
   This is a project about the effects of two forms of incivility (misspelling and inappropriate capitalization “shouting text”) on ratings of perceived trustworthiness (credibility).  The stimulus texts being rated are paragraphs in the form of answers to questions on an unmoderated online health forum about multiple sclerosis.  The ratings took place online, with participants recruited online by potential participants wanting to be in scientific experiments.  The stimulus paragraphs were presented, and the ratings were gathered, via Qualtrics.

WHAT DOCUMENTS ARE HERE
   Supp Methods 1: There is a Word document that shows all the stimulus paragraphs, as well as indicating the changes made to each paragraph when it was misspelled or inappropriately capitalized.
   Supp methods 2: A word document showing the sources of the excerpts (ie how we went from native writing on the web to our text stimuli)
  Supp methods 3: a collection of inappropriately capitalized words (ie incivil "shouting text") from a tweet corpus; these were the words that we capitalized in our experimental stimuli.
  Supp methods 4: A list of misspellings that we used in our experiments, and verifications showing that these naturally occur on the web in health forums and other user-generated health text.
  Supp Methods 5: CHERRIES is a stadardized format to list and explain the format of an online survey.
   There is also an Excel document with the raw data from Qualtrics, reformulated as a four-column data sheet for a Linear Mixed Effects model.
