WHAT IS THIS PROJECT ABOUT
   This is a project about the effects of two forms of incivility (misspelling and inappropriate capitalization “shouting text”) on ratings of perceived trustworthiness (credibility).  The stimulus texts being rated are paragraphs in the form of answers to questions on an unmoderated online health forum about multiple sclerosis.  The ratings took place online, with participants recruited from the UK via Facebook and the JISC programme’s callforparticipants.  The stimulus paragraphs were presented, and the ratings were gathered, via Qualtrics.

WHAT DOCUMENTS ARE HERE
   There is a Word document that shows all the stimulus paragraphs, as well as indicating the changes made to each paragraph when it was misspelled or inappropriately capitalized.
   There is an Excel document with the raw data from Qualtrics, reformulated as a four-column data sheet for a Linear Mixed Effects model.
